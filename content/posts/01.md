## Installation Steps

### Create a new Nuxt 4 project

Start by creating a fresh Nuxt application. This command initializes a new project named `my-nuxt-app`, sets up the basic directory structure, and installs necessary dependencies.

```bash
npx nuxt init my-nuxt-app
cd my-nuxt-app
npm install
```

This sequence of commands creates a new directory, navigates into it, and then installs all initial project dependencies using `npm`. You can substitute `npm install` with `pnpm install`, `yarn install`, or `bun install` if you prefer to use a different package manager.

### Install the Nuxt UI package

With your Nuxt project initialized, the next step is to integrate Nuxt UI. This package provides a set of highly customizable UI components designed to work seamlessly with Nuxt and Tailwind CSS.
::code-group
```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @nuxt/ui
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @nuxt/ui
```

```bash [npm]
npm install @nuxt/ui
```

```bash [bun]
bun add @nuxt/ui
```
::

::callout{ color="warning"}
If you're using **pnpm**{.text-warning}, ensure you set [`shamefully-hoist=true`](https://pnpm.io/npmrc#shamefully-hoist) in your `.npmrc` file or install `tailwindcss` in your project's root directory.
::

After installing the package, you need to add the Nuxt UI module to your `nuxt.config.ts` file. This informs Nuxt to load and configure the UI library, making its components and functionalities available throughout your application.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['@nuxt/ui']
})
```

By adding `'@nuxt/ui'` to the `modules` array, Nuxt UI's components, composables, plugins, and configurations become globally accessible, streamlining your development process.

## Configuration

### Add Tailwind CSS

Nuxt UI requires Tailwind CSS for its styling foundation. While Nuxt UI often handles much of the Tailwind CSS setup implicitly through its module, it's beneficial to understand and ensure Tailwind CSS is properly installed and configured in your project, especially if you plan to use custom Tailwind classes or extend the default theme beyond Nuxt UI's components.

The provided context ended before detailing the full Tailwind CSS installation. The following steps are based on general knowledge for setting up Tailwind CSS within a Nuxt project.
::

1.  **Install Tailwind CSS, PostCSS, and Autoprefixer:**
    These are the core dependencies for integrating Tailwind CSS. `postcss` is essential for processing Tailwind's directives and optimizing the CSS, while `autoprefixer` automatically adds vendor prefixes to your CSS rules for better browser compatibility.

    ```bash
    npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
    ```
    (Replace `npm install` with your preferred package manager command: `pnpm add -D`, `yarn add -D`, or `bun add -D`)

2.  **Initialize Tailwind CSS Configuration:**
    This command generates two configuration files: `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js`. These files are crucial for customizing Tailwind CSS and ensuring it works correctly within your PostCSS setup.

    ```bash
    npx tailwindcss init -p
    ```

3.  **Configure `tailwind.config.js`:**
    Open `tailwind.config.js` and update the `content` array to include paths to all your project's template files (e.g., Vue components, HTML files). This allows Tailwind CSS to scan these files for classes and generate only the necessary CSS, leading to smaller bundle sizes. Nuxt UI automatically extends Tailwind CSS, so you might not need extensive additions here unless you're adding custom themes, colors, fonts, or plugins.

    ```javascript [tailwind.config.js]
    /** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
    export default {
      content: [
        './components/**/*.{vue,js,ts}',
        './layouts/**/*.vue',
        './pages/**/*.vue',
        './plugins/**/*.{js,ts}',
        './app.vue',
        './error.vue',
        './nuxt.config.ts'
      ],
      theme: {
        extend: {} // Extend Tailwind's default theme here
      },
      plugins: [] // Add any Tailwind plugins here
    }
    ```

4.  **Add Tailwind Directives to your Main CSS File (Optional but Recommended):**
    While Nuxt UI is designed to handle much of the Tailwind CSS integration, it's a good practice to create a main CSS file (e.g., `assets/css/main.css`) and include the Tailwind directives. This ensures Tailwind's base styles, components, and utility classes are properly injected into your project's stylesheet.

    ```css [assets/css/main.css]
    @tailwind base;
    @tailwind components;
    @tailwind utilities;
    ```

    Then, reference this CSS file in your `nuxt.config.ts` to make it global:

    ```typescript [nuxt.config.ts]
    export default defineNuxtConfig({
      modules: ['@nuxt/ui'],
      css: ['~/assets/css/main.css'] // Link your main CSS file
    })
    ```
    This step ensures a complete and explicit setup for Tailwind CSS, providing full control over its integration. Nuxt UI will then leverage this foundation for its components.

## Using Nuxt UI Components

With Nuxt UI properly configured, you can now start utilizing its rich set of components in your application. A key feature of Nuxt UI is its auto-import capability, meaning you typically do not need to explicitly import components in your script tags; you can use them directly in your templates.

### Example: A Basic Page with Nuxt UI Components

Let's create a simple `app.vue` (or `pages/index.vue`) file to demonstrate how to use a card and a button component, along with a dark mode toggle.

```vue [app.vue]
<template>
  <div class="min-h-screen flex flex-col items-center justify-center p-4 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-900 text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">
    <UCard class="w-full max-w-sm">
      <template #header>
        <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold text-center">Welcome to Nuxt 4!</h1>
      </template>

      <div class="space-y-4">
        <p class="text-center">
          You've successfully set up your Nuxt 4 project with Tailwind CSS v4 and Nuxt UI v4.
          Start building amazing things!
        </p>

        <UButton
          icon="i-heroicons-rocket-launch"
          to="https://ui.nuxt.com"
          target="_blank"
          variant="solid"
          color="primary"
          block
          label="Explore Nuxt UI Docs"
          class="mt-4"
        />

        <UButton
          :icon="isDark ? 'i-heroicons-sun' : 'i-heroicons-moon'"
          variant="ghost"
          block
          @click="toggleDark"
          class="mt-2"
        >
          Toggle {{ isDark ? 'Light' : 'Dark' }} Mode
        </UButton>
      </div>

      <template #footer>
        <p class="text-sm text-center">Built with ❤️ and Nuxt.</p>
      </template>
    </UCard>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { computed } from 'vue'
import { useColorMode } from '#app' // Nuxt composable for color mode

const colorMode = useColorMode()
const isDark = computed(() => colorMode.value === 'dark')

const toggleDark = () => {
  colorMode.preference = isDark.value ? 'light' : 'dark'
}
</script>
```

In this example:
-   The `<UCard>` component provides a structured and styled container for content.
-   The `<UButton>` component creates an interactive button, highly customizable with props for `icon`, `to` (for navigation), `target`, `variant`, `color`, and `block` (full width).
-   `useColorMode()` is a Nuxt UI composable that allows you to easily manage and toggle dark mode preferences, demonstrating the seamless integration and powerful features available.
-   Icons (e.g., `i-heroicons-rocket-launch`, `i-heroicons-sun`, `i-heroicons-moon`) are automatically available and rendered through Nuxt UI's integration with popular icon libraries.

## Running Your Application

To see your newly configured Nuxt 4 application in action, run the development server from your project's root directory:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command will start a local development server, typically accessible at `http://localhost:3000`. Open your web browser and navigate to this address. You should see your Nuxt application with the Nuxt UI components rendered and fully interactive. The development server also provides hot-module reloading, meaning changes you make to your code will automatically update in the browser without a manual refresh.
