Docker is a **containerization platform** that allows developers to package applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers. Containers ensure that your app runs consistently across different environments.

---

## Why Use Docker?

* **Consistency:** Works the same in development and production.
* **Isolation:** Each container runs independently.
* **Portability:** Runs anywhere—on your laptop, server, or the cloud.

## Installation

Download Docker Desktop for your OS from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/). After installation, verify it’s working:

```bash
docker --version
```

---

## Creating a Simple Docker App

1. **Create a simple app file:**

```javascript
// app.js
console.log('Hello from Docker!');
```

2. **Create a Dockerfile:**

```dockerfile
FROM node:18
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
CMD ["node", "app.js"]
```

3. **Build and run your container:**

```bash
docker build -t hello-docker .
docker run hello-docker
```

You’ll see the message `Hello from Docker!` in your terminal.

## Conclusion

Docker simplifies deployment and ensures consistency across environments. Once you understand the basics, you can explore **Docker Compose**, **multi-stage builds**, and **Kubernetes** for orchestration.

With Docker, your code truly runs anywhere!
