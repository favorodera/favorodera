# Favour Emeka

Hello â€” I&apos;m **Favour Emeka**, a frontend web developer based in Nigeria.

I write **Vue**, **Nuxt**, and **TypeScript** to build production-ready frontends that are scalable, maintainable, and focused on delivering real value. I currently work as a freelance frontend developer, shipping applications end-to-end with these core technologies.

I&apos;m passionate about web technologies and love sharing insights and collaborating with others.

Favouring simplicity over complexity when designing user experiences, I focus on details to deliver products that satisfy both clients and users.
