title: A Free Alternative to Figma Dev Mode for Developers
description: Figma’s Dev Mode paywall got you stuck? Here’s how to use Pixso to inspect designs, grab specs, and export assets—without paying a cent.

> **TL;DR:** Pixso lets developers inspect Figma designs for free—just import the shared Figma > file link and enable Dev Mode.

[Figma’s](https://www.figma.com/) introduced Dev Mode to improve design-to-development handoff by providing clear access to spacing, styling, tokens, and exportable assets. However, moving Dev Mode behind a paywall has created challenges for teams who primarily rely on the inspection view but don’t need full design-editing capabilities.

If your workflow relies primarily on:
* Inspecting component spacing and layout
* Extracting font sizes, weights, and colors
* Copying CSS, iOS, or Android code snippets
* Exporting SVGs, PNGs, or other assets

Then paying **$12/month** for Dev Mode may feel unnecessary—especially if you rarely open Figma for actual editing.

Fortunately, [Pixso](https://pixso.net/) offers a free alternative with the same inspection functionality. Developers can open shared design files, view structure and style details, and export assets directly—without requiring a paid plan.

## How the process works

::steps{level="3"}

### Copy the figma design link from you browser&apos;s url search bar

### Go to your Pixso workspace and click the import

### Paste the Figma URL and confirm.

### After import, enable Dev Mode and inspect the design just as you would in Figma.

## Why This Works Well
* No workflow change required for designers
* Developers get the inspection tools they need
* No Figma plan upgrades required
* Asset exporting and styling references remain consistent

This approach allows teams to maintain their existing design workflow while avoiding new subscription costs.
